  following items: What are the scientific objectives and innovations of this
  project? What does the project-team plan to do? How will the project-team do it?
  What are the expected outcomes? What will be the expected impact of this
  project?}

\section{REBUTTAL (if applicable)}
\instructions{If this proposal is a resubmission, include here the questions \&
responses to previous peer reviewers' comments and identify the substantive
changes incorporated in the research plan.  In addition, LPIs resubmitting
proposals must point out in the body of this research plan (e.g. in bold type,

\instructions{Describe the overall research project. Explain the main aim or
  hypothesis and the research proposed. Anchor the project in the relevant
  literature. 

  If applicable, please indicate the Technology Readiness Level (TRL)
  that you plan to achieve within the scope of this NPRP project. Please refer to
  the list of Technology Readiness Levels at

\subsection{ADVANCES ON STATE-OF-THE-ART}
\label{sec:objectives:adv}
\instructions{Describe the advance(s) your proposal would provide in knowledge
  and understanding in your field beyond the existing knowledge and/or
  technologies. 

  Explain to what extent your proposal explores creative, original,
  novel, or potentially transformative concepts.  

  If your project specifically
  aims to create innovative technologies or processes, then list the existing
  solutions (Prior Art -- patents and products) closest to your research and how
  your approach is better.  Also, list the specific aspects of your research that
  matter to end-users in this area (the benefits an end- user desires in and
  derives from a solution) and how you expect your proposed outcomes to perform
  better than existing available solutions on these requirements (some examples of
  end-user benefits are: low price, ease-of-use, high accuracy, high specificity,
  cost-efficient, low carbon footprint, etc.).}

\subsection{PRELIMINARY DATA OR STUDIES}
\label{sec:objectives:prel}
\instructions{Provide details on preliminary data related to this project and on
  related research projects (ongoing or previous) by members of the research-team,
  including QNRF projects (if any). Indicate any outputs (patents, publications,
  products, data sets, etc.) obtained from those projects.}

\section{METHODOLOGY AND PROJECT STRUCTURE}
\label{sec:method}

\subsection{METHODOLOGY}
\label{sec:method:method}
\instructions{Clearly describe and explain your overall methodology, methods or
  scientific plan, including any tools to be used. Avoid duplication with the
  section~\ref{sec:method:wps}.}

\begin{adjustwidth}{0.2in}{0in}
\end{adjustwidth}


\subsection{RESEARCH PLAN REQUIREMENTS REGARDING THE SECTIONS ON THE PROTECTION
OF HUMAN SUBJECTS SECTION; AND/OR ON THE VERTEBRATE ANIMAL CARE AND USE.}
\label{sec:method:animal}
\instructions{A Protection of Human Subjects section of the Research Plan is
  required for all applications proposing human subjects research. To assist in
  preparing the section on Protection of Human Subjects, possible scenarios on
  human subject involvement in research are provided in the ``Research Ethics and
  Regulatory Requirements'' document at
  \url{https://www.qnrf.org/en-us/Funding/Research-Programs/National-Priorities-Research-Program-NPRP}.
  All research projects will fall into one of these scenarios.  For all scenarios,
  applicants must provide sufficient information to allow the reviewers to
  determine if the designation of human subjects involvement is appropriate. The
  proposed research must meet all the requirements of applicable Ministry of
  Public Health policies for the protection of human subjects from research risks,
  and data and safety monitoring (when applicable).  An overview of the
  information that must be included in the Research Plan for activities involving
  the care and use of vertebrate animals is provided here
  \url{https://www.qnrf.org/en-us/Funding/Research-Programs/National-Priorities-Research-Program-NPRP}.}

\newpage
\subsection{TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION BY WORK PACKAGE}
\label{sec:method:wps}
\instructions{The WPs represent the main phase of the project. Their number is
  limited, usually about 4 to 8 in NPRP projects. It is recommended to have one WP
  for project management and one for communication and exploitation of the
  results. If the project involves research with human subjects or research with
  vertebrate animals the work must be described by jurisdiction and for all the
  institutions engaged in research as defined by the Ministry of Public Health
  [see \url{https://www.moph.gov.qa/about-us/Pages/research.aspx}].
  Please note that obtaining institutional ethical committee(s)
  review and approval is a regulatory requirement not a deliverable.  

  If relevant, provide a diagram showing the organization of the WPs among
  themselves (technical flow chart).

  For each WP describe:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item the objectives if any,
  \item the responsible person and the PIs involved,
  \item the detailed work program (a few lines per tasks, etc.),
  \item the deliverables (tangible outcomes produced by the WPs or by the tasks),
  \item the contributions of the main participants (Who does what?, PIs, post-docs, PhD/graduate students),
  \item a description of the methods and technical choices and the way in which solutions will be achieved,
  \item the risks and the back-up solutions envisaged,
  \item the performance site.
